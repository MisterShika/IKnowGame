# "I Know" Game

This is an application I developed a few years ago to assist in an activity for our English classroom. 
The game is meant to be used in a web browser on our institution's smart TVs. It mainly uses jQuery and 
[jQuery Drawr](https://rawrfl.es/jquery-drawr/), a drawing plugin for jQuery. It also keeps score for multiple
teams and auto-progresses after each "turn". This project hasn't been touched in a few years as goals
within the classroom unfortunately shifted away from activities and communication to finishing the
assigned textbooks.
